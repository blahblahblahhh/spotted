Spotted! is an app designed to aid in waste prevention. Simply use spotted! to report the location of any usable perishable items bound for trash so that those in need might obtain them before the dump does. Spotted! is
intended for use by businesses or farmers and for consumption by the general public.

## How is it used?

Each marker on the map represents available goods. Sign up to add your own items.

## As a user...

*I want to choose the appropriate location and add information about my goods that are available.*
  * Once verified as a farmer or businesses, you may create an account and log in.
  After logging in you may then create a post with all the relevant information!


*I want to be able to check availability of goods.*
  * If goods are still listed on the site and have not been removed by the poster,
  then they are still available.

*I want to be able to check remove the goods once they've been retrieved.*
  * A post may only be removed by the user who posted it, otherwise goods could
  be removed by anyone. To remove your post, simply log in to your account and
  search for your post in the available goods section. Once you have located the
  appropriate post, click the green '?' in the upper right hand corner of the post.
  THIS WILL PERMANENTLY DELETE YOUR POST. This feature is only available to logged
  in users, and only if the post is yours.

*I want to use this app on my phone.*
  * Spotted! is responsive and will work on your phone/tablet!

## Future versions
In a my next update, only the poster will be able to see the 'remove' feature.
